By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to&#xa;guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the&#xa;software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to&#xa;most of the Free Software Foundation&apos;s software and to any other program whose&#xa;authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is&#xa;covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to&#xa;your programs, too.&#xa;&#xa;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our&#xa;General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to&#xa;distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),&#xa;that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change&#xa;the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you&#xa;can do these things.&#xa;&#xa;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny&#xa;you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions&#xa;translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the&#xa;software, or if you modify it.&#xa;&#xa;For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for&#xa;a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must&#xa;make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must&#xa;show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xa;&#xa;We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)&#xa;offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute&#xa;and/or modify the software.&#xa;&#xa;Also, for each author&apos;s protection and ours, we want to make certain that&#xa;everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the&#xa;software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to&#xa;know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced&#xa;by others will not reflect on the original authors&apos; reputations.&#xa;&#xa;Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We&#xa;wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will&#xa;individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.&#xa;To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for&#xa;everyone&apos;s free use or not licensed at all.&#xa;&#xa;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification&#xa;follow.&#xa;&#xa;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xa;&#xa;0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice&#xa;placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of&#xa;this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below, refers to any such program&#xa;or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot; means either the Program or any&#xa;derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the&#xa;Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or&#xa;translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included&#xa;without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.) Each licensee is addressed as&#xa;&quot;you&quot;.&#xa;&#xa;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by&#xa;this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is&#xa;not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents&#xa;constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by&#xa;running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.&#xa;&#xa;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as&#xa;you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&#xa;appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and&#xa;disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License&#xa;and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the&#xa;Program a copy of this License along with the Program.&#xa;&#xa;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may&#xa;at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.&#xa;&#xa;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus&#xa;forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications&#xa;or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of&#xa;these conditions:&#xa;&#xa;    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating&#xa;    that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xa;&#xa;    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or&#xa;    in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be&#xa;    licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of&#xa;    this License.&#xa;&#xa;    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,&#xa;    you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the&#xa;    most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an&#xa;    appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or&#xa;    else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute&#xa;    the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy&#xa;    of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does&#xa;    not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is&#xa;    not required to print an announcement.)&#xa;&#xa;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable&#xa;sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably&#xa;considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and&#xa;its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate&#xa;works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a&#xa;work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms&#xa;of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire&#xa;whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.&#xa;&#xa;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your&#xa;rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the&#xa;right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on&#xa;the Program.&#xa;&#xa;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the&#xa;Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or&#xa;distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this&#xa;License.&#xa;&#xa;3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under&#xa;Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and&#xa;2 above provided that you also do one of the following:&#xa;&#xa;    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source&#xa;    code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above&#xa;    on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,&#xa;&#xa;    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to&#xa;    give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically&#xa;    performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the&#xa;    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1&#xa;    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,&#xa;&#xa;    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to&#xa;    distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only&#xa;    for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in&#xa;    object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with&#xa;    Subsection b above.)&#xa;&#xa;The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making&#xa;modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all&#xa;the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface&#xa;definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation&#xa;of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code&#xa;distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either&#xa;source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)&#xa;of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component&#xa;itself accompanies the executable.&#xa;&#xa;If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy&#xa;from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source&#xa;code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though&#xa;third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xa;&#xa;4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as&#xa;expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,&#xa;sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate&#xa;your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or&#xa;rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so&#xa;long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#xa;&#xa;5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.&#xa;However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program&#xa;or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not&#xa;accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or&#xa;any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to&#xa;do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xa;the Program or works based on it.&#xa;&#xa;6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),&#xa;the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to&#xa;copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.&#xa;You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the&#xa;rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by&#xa;third parties to this License.&#xa;&#xa;7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent&#xa;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions&#xa;are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that&#xa;contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the&#xa;conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy&#xa;simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent&#xa;obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.&#xa;For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution&#xa;of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through&#xa;you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to&#xa;refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&#xa;&#xa;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any&#xa;particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and&#xa;the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#xa;&#xa;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or&#xa;other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this&#xa;section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software&#xa;distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many&#xa;people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software&#xa;distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that&#xa;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to&#xa;distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that&#xa;choice.&#xa;&#xa;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a&#xa;consequence of the rest of this License.&#xa;&#xa;8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain&#xa;countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original&#xa;copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit&#xa;geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that&#xa;distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In&#xa;such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body&#xa;of this License.&#xa;&#xa;9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the&#xa;General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in&#xa;spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems&#xa;or concerns.&#xa;&#xa;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program&#xa;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any later&#xa;version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of&#xa;that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.&#xa;If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may&#xa;choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.&#xa;&#xa;10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs&#xa;whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for&#xa;permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,&#xa;write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.&#xa;Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of&#xa;all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of&#xa;software generally.&#xa;&#xa;NO WARRANTY&#xa;&#xa;11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR&#xa;THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE&#xa;STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE&#xa;PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,&#xa;INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND&#xa;FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND&#xa;PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,&#xa;YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xa;&#xa;12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL&#xa;ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE&#xa;PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY&#xa;GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR&#xa;INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA&#xa;BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A&#xa;FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER&#xa;OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xa;&#xa;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xa;&#xa;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&#xa;&#xa;If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible&#xa;use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software&#xa;which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.&#xa;&#xa;To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach&#xa;them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion&#xa;of warranty; and each file should have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a&#xa;pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xa;&#xa;    One line to give the program&apos;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&#xa;&#xa;    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;&#xa;&#xa;    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it&#xa;    under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free&#xa;    Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option)&#xa;    any later version.&#xa;&#xa;    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT&#xa;    ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or&#xa;    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for&#xa;    more details.&#xa;&#xa;    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along&#xa;    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59&#xa;    Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA&#xa;&#xa;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.&#xa;&#xa;If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it&#xa;starts in an interactive mode:&#xa;&#xa;    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes&#xa;    with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type &apos;show w&apos;.  This is free&#xa;    software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions;&#xa;    type &apos;show c&apos; for details.&#xa;&#xa;The hypothetical commands &apos;show w&apos; and &apos;show c&apos; should show the appropriate&#xa;parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may be&#xa;called something other than &apos;show w&apos; and &apos;show c&apos;; they could even be&#xa;mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.&#xa;&#xa;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,&#xa;if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if necessary.  Here&#xa;is a sample; alter the names:&#xa;&#xa;    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program&#xa;    &apos;Gnomovision&apos; (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.&#xa;&#xa;    signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989&#xa;&#xa;    Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xa;&#xa;This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into&#xa;proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may&#xa;consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the&#xa;library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public&#xa;License instead of this License.&#xa;&#xa;&#xa;&quot;CLASSPATH&quot; EXCEPTION TO THE GPL&#xa;&#xa;Certain source files distributed by Oracle America and/or its affiliates are&#xa;subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPL, but&#xa;only where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file&apos;s header&#xa;the words &quot;Oracle designates this particular file as subject to the &quot;Classpath&quot;&#xa;exception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file that accompanied this code.&quot;&#xa;&#xa;    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making&#xa;    a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and conditions of&#xa;    the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.&#xa;&#xa;    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you&#xa;    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an&#xa;    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules,&#xa;    and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your&#xa;    choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module,&#xa;    the terms and conditions of the license of that module.  An independent&#xa;    module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library.  If&#xa;    you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of&#xa;    the library, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do&#xa;    so, delete this exception statement from your version.&#xa;&#xa;&#xa;&#xa;&#xa;ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT LICENSING&#xa;&#xa;Certain files distributed by Oracle America, Inc. and/or its affiliates are&#xa;subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPLv2,&#xa;based on the GNU Project exception for its Classpath libraries, known as the&#xa;GNU Classpath Exception.&#xa;&#xa;Note that Oracle includes multiple, independent programs in this software&#xa;package.  Some of those programs are provided under licenses deemed&#xa;incompatible with the GPLv2 by the Free Software Foundation and others.&#xa;For example, the package includes programs licensed under the Apache&#xa;License, Version 2.0 and may include FreeType. Such programs are licensed&#xa;to you under their original licenses.&#xa;&#xa;Oracle facilitates your further distribution of this package by adding the&#xa;Classpath Exception to the necessary parts of its GPLv2 code, which permits&#xa;you to use that code in combination with other independent modules not&#xa;licensed under the GPLv2. However, note that this would not permit you to&#xa;commingle code under an incompatible license with Oracle&apos;s GPLv2 licensed&#xa;code by, for example, cutting and pasting such code into a file also&#xa;containing Oracle&apos;s GPLv2 licensed code and then distributing the result.&#xa;&#xa;Additionally, if you were to remove the Classpath Exception from any of the&#xa;files to which it applies and distribute the result, you would likely be&#xa;required to license some or all of the other code in that distribution under&#xa;the GPLv2 as well, and since the GPLv2 is incompatible with the license terms&#xa;of some items included in the distribution by Oracle, removing the Classpath&#xa;Exception could therefore effectively compromise your ability to further&#xa;distribute the package.&#xa;&#xa;Failing to distribute notices associated with some files may also create&#xa;unexpected legal consequences.&#xa;&#xa;Proceed with caution and we recommend that you obtain the advice of a lawyer&#xa;skilled in open source matters before removing the Classpath Exception or&#xa;making modifications to this package which may subsequently be redistributed&#xa;and/or involve the use of third party software.&#xa;&#xa;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&#xa;                          Apache License&#xa;                    Version 2.0, January 2004&#xa;                 http://www.apache.org/licenses/&#xa;&#xa;   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION&#xa;&#xa;   1. Definitions.&#xa;&#xa;      &quot;License&quot; shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,&#xa;      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.&#xa;&#xa;      &quot;Licensor&quot; shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by&#xa;      the copyright owner that is granting the License.&#xa;&#xa;      &quot;Legal Entity&quot; shall mean the union of the acting entity and all&#xa;      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common&#xa;      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,&#xa;      &quot;control&quot; means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the&#xa;      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or&#xa;      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the&#xa;      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.&#xa;&#xa;      &quot;You&quot; (or &quot;Your&quot;) shall mean an individual or Legal Entity&#xa;      exercising permissions granted by this License.&#xa;&#xa;      &quot;Source&quot; form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,&#xa;      including but not limited to software source code, documentation&#xa;      source, and configuration files.&#xa;&#xa;      &quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical&#xa;      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but&#xa;      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,&#xa;      and conversions to other media types.&#xa;&#xa;      &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or&#xa;      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a&#xa;      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work&#xa;      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).&#xa;&#xa;      &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object&#xa;      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the&#xa;      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications&#xa;      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes&#xa;      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain&#xa;      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,&#xa;      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.&#xa;&#xa;      &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including&#xa;      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions&#xa;      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally&#xa;      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner&#xa;      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of&#xa;      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;&#xa;      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent&#xa;      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to&#xa;      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,&#xa;      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the&#xa;      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but&#xa;      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise&#xa;      designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;&#xa;&#xa;      &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity&#xa;      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and&#xa;      subsequently incorporated within the Work.&#xa;&#xa;   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of&#xa;      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,&#xa;      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable&#xa;      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,&#xa;      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the&#xa;      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.&#xa;&#xa;   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of&#xa;      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,&#xa;      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable&#xa;      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,&#xa;      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,&#xa;      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable&#xa;      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their&#xa;      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)&#xa;      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.
